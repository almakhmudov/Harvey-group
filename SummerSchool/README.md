# Summer School in Computational Chemistry

> [!WARNING]
>  The course content is currently a work in progress. 

The summer school is hosted at the KU Leuven for interested high-school students. Visit the [website](https://wet.kuleuven.be/welcomeatscience/summerofscience) for more information.

## Abstract

... 

This course introduces you to the fascinating world of computational chemistry and molecular modelling. Each day combines a theory session in the morning and a hands-on application session in the afternoon, giving you a balanced mix of knowledge and practice.

Course domain: biochemistry, computational chemistry, molecular modelling

## Curriculum

| Timeline | Description |
|--|--|
| Day 1 | Biomolecular interactions and protein structure: <br>Learn what are the building blocks in our bodies. What are the key chemical interactions. The use of protein visualization tools. |
| Day 2 | Protein structure prediction: <br>(AI) tools for predicting structures of proteins. |
| Day 3 | QSAR and Machine Learning in Chemistry: <br>Learn the basics of machine learning and see how this powerful tool is revolutionizing computational chemistry, from predicting properties to optimizing molecules. |
| Day 4 | Designing Drugs – Molecular Docking: <br>Discover how new drugs are designed by simulating how small molecules bind to proteins using molecular docking techniques. |
| Day 5 | Protein Movements – Molecular Dynamics Simulations: <br>Explore how proteins move and interact over time by performing molecular dynamics simulations to study their dynamic nature. |
