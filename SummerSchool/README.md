# PROTEINS: From Amino Acids to Structure and Modelling of Diseases

> [!WARNING]
>  The course content is currently a work in progress. 

The summer school is hosted at the KU Leuven for interested high-school students. Visit the [website](https://wet.kuleuven.be/welcomeatscience/summerofscience) for more information.

## Abstract

Proteins are the tiny machines that make life possible, from enzymes that speed up reactions to those that can cause diseases. Amazingly, all proteins are made from just a handful of simple building blocks called amino acids. These blocks form sequences that determine their 3D shape and function. In todayâ€™s world, powerful computers and AI tools are helping us decode these structures like never before - a breakthrough recognized with the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In this course, you'll experience both the computational revolution and classic wet-lab techniques that are transforming our understanding of proteins.
Through hands-on computer and laboratory sessions, you'll gain exciting skills that professional scientists use every day:
- Visualize and manipulate protein structures in the computer
- Predict protein structures using cutting-edge AI technologies
- Isolate proteins from cells and separate them on a gel
- Simulate protein movements and dynamics
If you're curious about how science and technology can help us understand life at its most fundamental level, this course is for you!
